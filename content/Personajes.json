His father, King Robert I Baratheon, is deeply disappointed with his son and feels little affection for Joffreyâ€“ nor did he like the fact that Joffrey would always cry whenever Robert picked him up. It is implied that Joffrey craves Robert's respect and approval, and many of his acts are done in an effort to live up to his father's standards. Once after learning a kitchen cat was pregnant, Joffrey killed the animal and cut open its belly to see the kittens inside. He showed one of the unborn kittens to his father. Robert was so shocked and angry he hit Joffrey so hard it knocked out two of his baby teeth. Queen Cersei Lannister believes Robert would have beaten the boy if she had allowed it. It is also implied Joffrey bullied his younger brother, Tommen.",

Once, Robb and Jon built a great mountain of snow above a gate. They were spotted by Mance Rayder, then a brother of the Night's Watch, who had accompanied the visiting Lord Commander Qorgyle. Mance promised not to tell on them, and the two boys eventually dumped the snow on Fat Tom, the slowest of Lord Eddard's household guards, who chased them around afterward.",

There, Stannis believed he saw King Aerys II Targaryen on the Iron Throne, holding court. Stannis was impressed, and he and Robert agreed that the king had been as noble as the dragons were fearsome. It was years later that Steffon told him that it had been the Hand of the King, Lord Tywin Lannister, whom they had seen, as King Aerys had cut himself on the throne earlier that day and Tywin had taken over for him. As a lad, Stannis found an injured goshawk, and nursed it back to health. He named the bird Proudwing, but his brother Robert called it Weakwing, as it would never fly higher than the treetops, and never soared. (Robert himself owned a gyrfalcon named Thunderclap, who never missed a strike). Eventually, Stannis's great-uncle, Harbert, convinced him to abandon the bird, stating that Stannis was making a fool of himself with it.",

It was said that Tyrion's birth was an omen to famine, plague and war,[7] and the smallfolk named him \"Lord Tywin's Doom\" and \"Lord Tywin's Bane\". King Aerys II Targaryen stated that Tyrion was a punishment for Tywin's arrogance,and the same was said by begging brothers in Oldtown, stating that Tywin had made himself greater than the king, which was only allowed by a god. Shortly after Tyrion's birth, the Princess of Dorne arrived with her consort and two younger children, Elia and Oberyn Martell. Tyrion was kept out of sight during the visit of the Martells, though he could sometimes be heard howling. Cersei and Jaime showed Tyrion to Elia and Oberyn the day before the Martells left, with Cersei claiming the infant would die soon. Lord Tywin, having refused to betroth Princess Elia to his heir Jaime, offered Tyrion as a betrothed to Elia instead, which the Martells took as an insult.",
